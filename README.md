# Watersort
Development
Java of water sort puzzle using stacks
Watersort was one of the first programs where I used a higher level of thinking while also building something that can be used and can be visually seen and understood by others.
in this first version it uses stacks to place the colors for the watersort puzzle and in the next version it mixes these colors randomly from the completed state.
mixing from the completed state ensure that there is a solution to the puzzle.
