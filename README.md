# Watersort

## Introduction

Watersort is a Java program that implements the water sort puzzle using stacks. It was one of my first projects where I applied higher-level thinking to build something that other people can play as well. The program allows users to solve the water sort puzzle by arranging colors in a specific order using stacks although everything is text based.

## Features

- Water Sort Puzzle: The program simulates the popular water sort puzzle, where the objective is to arrange colors in a specific order using stacks.
- Stack Implementation: The puzzle colors are represented using stacks, providing a suitable data structure for organizing and manipulating the elements.
- Random Mixing: In the next version of the program, the colors will be mixed randomly from the completed state. This ensures that there is always a solution to the puzzle.
